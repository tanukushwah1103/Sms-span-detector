# Sms-spam-detector
Detects spam SMS messages using ML models like Naive Bayes &amp; SVM
# SMS Spam Detector using Naive Bayes & SVM

This project is part of my internship at **Hunar Intern**.  
It uses machine learning algorithms to classify SMS messages as either **spam** or **not spam (ham)** using **Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models.

## 📂 Files Included

- `sms_spam_detector.py` : Python code for model building and evaluation  
- `spam.csv` : Dataset used for training and testing the model *(optional but recommended)*  
- `output_confusion_matrix.png` : Output image showing confusion matrix (Naive Bayes)

## 🧠 Libraries Used

- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn

## 💻 Run Environment

The code was developed and executed using **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PK5TaZvJi6cDc4Ln8o_EcDb4253o25VU#scrollTo=xkoDSpkteu5r)**.

⚠️ Due to mobile limitations, the output graph is attached separately as an image.
